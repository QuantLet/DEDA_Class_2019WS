Description:          'Retrieval of FRM Crypto as well as the quantile regression coefficients based on the returns of the   

                      12 coins and 2 macro-economic variables with window size 24 and 48,  using quantile LASSO regression and  
                      
                      GACV method provided in the conventional FRM model. Moreover, transform the retrieved coefficients file
                      
                      into a row-wise daily coefficient matrix, based on which we will create a moving network plot in section 8.'



Keywords:             quantile LASSO, GACV, FRM Crypto, regularization parameter, quantile regression coefficient, plotting
